<h1> The best movies according to sudeep</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr>
<h3>IRON MAN 1</h3>
<P>The first Iron Man film was intense, right from the get go. When I dragged my wife to watch it with me, the first 20 minutes had her going “I was expecting light & fluffy comic book movie, this”</P>
<h3>AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON</h3>
<p>Personally, this movie was to fictional with the whole flying city thing, too much technology and some scenes (i.e when Thor saved people from a car falling to the other part of the city, he just grabbed them n threw them in the air like small-sized stones). 
    There isnt much storyline, u barely understand what is what, like how did ultron have such bad intentions when he was just programmed to fyt alonside avengers.</p>
<h3>AVENGERS ENG GAME</h3>
<P>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. </P>
